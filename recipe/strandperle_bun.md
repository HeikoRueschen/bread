# Strandperle Bun #

This recipe originated from a visit at **Strandperle Restaurant** in Hamburg, Germany.
At [Strandperle](https://www.strandperle-hamburg.de/home.html) they used a very delicious sourdough bun to serve all sorts of breakfast sandwiches. The tasty bun supported the creations very elegantly. This was the attempt to recreate the taste at home.

Preparation time: 8 hrs.

Sourdough:
100g     T110 Full grain wheat flour
100g     Water 50°C
100g     sourdough starter (Werner)


Autolyse dough:
450g    Elsässer Bun flour
60g      black rye flour or alps rye flour T1500
300g    Water 20°C

Autolyse dough
14g    Salt

After proving, mix both doughs and the salt for at least 8 minutes in the kneader.
Let the dough prove for another 150 minutes (2:30 hrs). After 50 and 100 minutes stretch and fold the dough.
After proving, create 12 little dough pieces and roll them to little flat buns. Store them another 60 minutes in baker linen.
