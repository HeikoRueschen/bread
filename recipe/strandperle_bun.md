# Starndperle Bun #

This recipe originated from a visit at **Strandperle Restaurant** in Hamburg, Germany.
At [Strandperle](https://www.strandperle-hamburg.de/home.html) they used a very delicious sourdough bun to serve all sorts of breakfast sandwiches. The tasty bun supported the creations very elegantly. This was the attempt to recreate the taste at home.

Preparation time: 8 hrs.
