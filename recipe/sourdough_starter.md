## Process
To be able to create the most *delicious* sourdough bread in the **entire world** and keep doing so you only need the stuff outlined in the checklist above.

First of all we need to create the sourdough itself by processing flour and water over a period of 1 week.

Day | Activity
-------- | ------
1 | Mix 50 g flour with 50 ml water and let it rest in warm spot for 24 hrs
2 | Discard half of the dough and add 50g flour and 5 ml water and put it at a warm spot for 24hrs
3-5 | Repeat day 2 procedure
6 | Discard half of the dough and add 100g flour and 100 ml water and let it prove for another 24 hrs
7 | your sourdough starter culture is ready to be used :octocat: 

In case of uncertainty donâ€™t hesitate to ask @HeikoRueschen

You can use this sourdough starter over and over again. Whenever you bake bread and take some of the starter to create your sourdogh, make sure to keep some of the starter and feed it with water and flour. My starter is now almost 2 years old and we name it "Werner" because its made of wheat flour (Weizenmehl in German).
You can keep the starter in the fridge for about 1 week without feeding it. After on week you need to start feeding again with flour and water. In case you plan a longer absence you can also deep freeze the starter culture and reactivate it on your return.
